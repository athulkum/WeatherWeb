🌤️ Weather Web Project 🌤️
I'm excited to share my latest project: a fully-functional Weather Web Application, built using Java, Servlets, Apache Tomcat, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a real-time Weather API. This application delivers accurate, up-to-date weather data in a clean and intuitive interface.
🔸 Key Features:
◾ Real-Time Temperature: View the current temperature for any location.
◾ Humidity Levels: Get informed on current humidity conditions.
◾ Wind Speed: Stay updated with real-time wind speed metrics.
◾ Current Date: Always see the current date alongside weather data.
🔸 Tech Stack:
◾ Java & Servlets: Backend logic and server-side processing.
◾ Apache Tomcat: Web server hosting the application.
◾ HTML & CSS: Structure and style the UI for a seamless user experience.
◾ JavaScript​: Enables dynamic updates and interactive features.
◾ Weather API: Fetches live weather data for accurate reporting.
This project highlights my ability to blend multiple technologies to develop responsive and user-focused web applications. I'm eager to apply these skills in future projects and contribute to impactful web development solutions.
